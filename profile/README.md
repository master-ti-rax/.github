The **TI-RAX** project contributes to the **MASTER** ecosystem by developing immersive **extended-reality training environments** for industrial robotics education. The project transforms structured educational designs into fully operational interactive simulations deployed through the **VIROO platform**. By combining artificial intelligence, multi-agent content generation, and extended reality technologies, the TI-RAX project supports realistic, scalable, and pedagogically grounded training experiences focused on industrial scenarios.

## Project Goals

The TI-RAX project addresses several challenges in vocational education and training based on extended reality:

- **Bridging design and deployment**: Educational concepts often remain difficult to operationalize in immersive environments.  
  *TI-RAX transforms educational worksheets into deployable applications via an intelligent generation and integration workflow.*

- **Realistic safety training**: Hazardous scenarios are difficult to reproduce safely in traditional training contexts.  
  *TI-RAX leverages simulations to recreate high-risk situations, enabling experiential learning without physical danger.*

- **Content creation scalability**: Developing extended reality scenes typically requires significant manual effort.  
  *TI-RAX introduces a multi-agent generation pipeline that accelerates development and integration within the VIROO platform.*
  
- **Public accessibility**: Extended reality applications require to be deployable into easy-to-access infrastructures.  
  *TI-RAX enables external users to access and play with the applications through the VIROO player within the MASTER ecosystem.*
